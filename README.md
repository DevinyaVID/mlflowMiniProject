🧠 Project: Probability of Default (PD) Prediction Model with MLflow Tracking and Registry
This document provides a clear, beginner-friendly explanation of a machine learning (ML) mini-project using MLflow. It walks through the entire process step by step, even for those who have not used MLflow or built ML models before.

🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will default on a loan (Probability of Default or PD), and to track the entire model development and deployment process using MLflow.

🧰 What is MLflow?
MLflow is a tool that helps you manage the lifecycle of machine learning models. With MLflow, you can:
•	Track model parameters, metrics, and artifacts (like plots)
•	Save and load models.
•	Register models in a model registry.
•	Manage different versions of models.
•	Transition models to various stages (e.g., Staging, Production)

🧱 Step-by-Step Explanation of the Project
✅ Step 1: Install Libraries
!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn mlflow
These libraries help us with data processing (pandas), machine learning (scikit-learn), visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn), and MLflow tracking.
________________________________________
✅ Step 2: Import Libraries
We load all the required libraries for model training and tracking.
________________________________________
✅ Step 3: Generate Sample Data
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
We generate a fake dataset that simulates customer data for loan applications, with a target variable representing whether they defaulted or not.
________________________________________
✅ Step 4: Train a Classification Model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
We train a Random Forest classifier to predict loan default based on customer features. We evaluate it using two metrics:
•	Accuracy: How many predictions were correct
•	ROC AUC: How well the model separates defaulters from non-defaulters
________________________________________
✅ Step 5: Track the Model Using MLflow
mlflow.set_experiment("PD_Classification_Experiment")
with mlflow.start_run():
    ...
Inside this block, we:
•	Log parameters (e.g., number of trees, depth)
•	Log metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROC AUC)
•	Log artifacts (e.g., confusion matrix plot, ROC curve)
•	Log and register the trained model to the Model Registry
________________________________________
✅ Step 6: Visualize Model Performance
We generate:
•	A confusion matrix: Shows true/false predictions
•	A ROC curve: Plots model's performance across thresholds Both are logged as images in MLflow.
________________________________________
✅ Step 7: Register and Version the Model
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model", registered_model_name="pd_model_v1")
This saves the model in MLflow and adds it to a named model registry (pd_model_v1). Each time you log a new model with this name, MLflow creates a new version.
________________________________________
✅ Step 8: Load the Model Later for Use
mlflow.sklearn.load_model("models:/pd_model_v1/latest")
You can load the saved model any time in the future and use it to make predictions.
________________________________________
✅ Step 9: Promote the Model to Production
MlflowClient().transition_model_version_stage(...)
This marks a version of the model as "Production", meaning it's now the official model to use. You can also transition models to:
•	Staging (for testing)
•	Archived (for old versions)
________________________________________
✅ Step 10: Fine-Tune the Model
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
We use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for our model and improve performance. The best model can also be logged and promoted using MLflow.

📊 MLflow Dashboard
After starting the MLflow UI with:
mlflow ui
You can view all your:
•	Experiments
•	Runs
•	Metrics & parameters
•	Model versions
•	Visual artifacts
•	Registered models
Access it via: http://127.0.0.1:5000
________________________________________
✅ Final Result
You’ve created a complete end-to-end ML pipeline that:
•	Trains and evaluates a model.
•	Logs everything automatically
•	Registers and version-controls the model.
•	Loads and reuses the model.
•	Promotes the best model to production.
________________________________________
🏁 Why This Is Valuable
This mimics a real-world ML workflow used in companies:
•	Track experiments
•	Compare results.
•	Reuse & deploy reliable models.
•	Keep everything reproducible & organized.
